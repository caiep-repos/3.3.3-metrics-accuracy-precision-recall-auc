# Classification Metrics from Scratch

## Problem Description

In this assignment, you will implement several common classification metrics from scratch using NumPy. You will be given true labels and predicted labels (or scores) and will need to calculate accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC).

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the definitions and importance of various classification metrics.
- Implement accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Understand the ROC curve and implement AUC calculation.
- Evaluate the performance of a classification model.

## Setup Instructions

1.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Instructions

1.  Open the `assignment.py` file.
2.  You will find several function definitions. Your task is to implement them.
    *   **Task 1**: Implement the `accuracy_score` function.
    *   **Task 2**: Implement the `precision_score` function.
    *   **Task 3**: Implement the `recall_score` function.
    *   **Task 4**: Implement the `f1_score` function.
    *   **Task 5**: Implement the `roc_auc_score` function.

## Testing Your Solution

Run the test file to verify your implementation:

```bash
python -m unittest test
```
